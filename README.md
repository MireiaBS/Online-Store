### *Using JavaScript, CSS3, Bootstrap5 and SASS*


In this small project I put into practice the basics of **JavaScript**.
The project is about a simple shopping website. The idea is to create a shopping cart that accumulates the products without repeating them, see the prices and their respective discounts.
Above we will have the cart button, to see a summary of the products we have and if we want to empty the list, and at checkout, we will validate that the data entered is correct under a series of rules.

We implement a button to remove the products, and another in the Cart to delete the entire list.

Using loops, we ensure that the cart does not accumulate repeated products, increasing their **quantities** and calculating their prices and discounts at the same time. Thus, we will obtain a clean and intuitive array.

Another important part is a correct validation of the forms. Using regular expressions, it is easy to establish rules, complementing it with conditionals.

Adding and removing classes that we have predefined, or using those that Bootstrap offers us in this case, we make the result more visual for the client, and we facilitate the correction in case of error.

Last but not least, a simple layout to make the website more attractive and eye-catching, although we also try to make it as easy to use as possible.
It is important to know that the client is adapting the page, to understand their needs and adapt the website to them.
